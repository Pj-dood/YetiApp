Quick Point and Click Idea for a Yeti Tablet


The Yeti game is a mobile app designed for dementia patients, providing a calming and interactive experience that simulates a walk in the forest. The game has three main screens: the main menu, the forest entry, and the bridge in the forest. Each screen offers different sounds and animations, such as a butterfly flying in circles, and the landscapes which respond to user touch by making noises. The app aims to stimulate the patient's sensory and cognitive functions by providing a simple, engaging and familiar environment. Additionally, the app includes relaxing background music, making the experience more enjoyable for the users.
